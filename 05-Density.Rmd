# Density plots {#density}


:::note
You should use this method if the data is:

- Numeric and continuous
:::

In this chapter you will learn how to do some simple data explorations for numerical variables using density plots. 

## One variable

```{r}

wage_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wage)) +
  geom_density()

```

## Two variables

Combine your numeric variable with a categorical variable:

```{r}

wage_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wage, fill = education)) + 
  geom_density() 

```

Make some adjustments:

```{r}

wage_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wage, fill = education)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues")

```
